		- Site Name - This will appear at the top of your browser windows and is 
		the name of your portal. IntegraMOD adds the term 'Forum' after this 
		text as the title of your system.<br>
		- Description - Go on, sell yourself. This is where you detail what you 
		site is about and who it is aimed at.<br>
		- Disable board - DO NOT click Yes to this and log out. You will find it 
		difficult to log back in if the board is disabled.<br>
		- Enable account activation - This is to help moderate who joins your 
		board. It may be wise to initially set this as 'Admin', and it means you 
		will need to approve anyone who joins. Once you are happy that your 
		e-mail from the board is functioning properly, you will generally want 
		to select 'User' here. This means this user will need to verify there 
		e-mail address when they join. Unless you wish a completely anonymous 
		Forum, or you are having mailing difficulty it would be preferable not 
		to keep this set at 'None'<br>
		- User email via board - If selected 'Yes' then users will be able to 
		mail via an e-mail messaging page, in order to protect that mail address 
		from anyone other than the owner. If No is selected, the e-mail button 
		holds the address and is linked to open the sender's mail program for a 
		new mail on clicking the e-mail button.<br>
		- Default Language - This dropdown will only show installed languages.<br>
		- System Timezone - This is the Timezone your Host server is based in.<br>
		- Logo Setting - you are able to change aspects of your main logo here.<br>
		- Cookie name - If you have had another phpbb type forum before on your 
		domain, it is highly recommended that you change the cookie name to 
		different one as it can conflict when previous users of older forums 
		come to visit your new site.<br>
		- Avatar Settings - IntegraMOD now has a set of avatars within your 
		install. You can add more folders of avatars in the 
		Images/Avatars/Gallery/ directory. To enable the user to use them, 
		select Enable gallery avatars. Using remote avatars or allowing the 
		uploading of avatars carries a small security risk, but the benefits 
		encourage individuality and can help to maintain your memory usage.<br>
		- Admin Email Address - This will go out on all automatically 
		distributed mail from your site. It may be worth using specific address 
		purely for this purpose.<br>
		- Use SMTP Server for email - You may not need to set up this as most 
		servers will send out mail without external SMTP. It is worth testing 
		first to see if you need this to be set.<br>
		- PayPal IPN Settings - IntegraMOD 1.4.0 onwards, has greater 
		integration with PayPal to promote your site funding. Take care that you 
		set these correctly. And feel free to share the wealth this way, if you 
		so wish :)</td>
