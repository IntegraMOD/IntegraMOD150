1: SECURITY
Because updates overwrite the phpbb_security.php file resulting in people not being able to 
access security options I have come up with a different method which should avoid the problem.

I have added phpbb_security_install.php and removed the phpbb_security.php file. 
Now updates will not overwrite your security file. 

If you want install another copy or a complete new install just remember to delete the 
phpbb_security.php file and rename phpbb_security_install.php to phpbb_security.php.


2: IMAGEMAGICK PATH
If you are using XAMPP and Windows your imagemagic path should be C:\ImageMagick to suite album_picm.php.
If you have used the default windows installation for imagemagick (latest version) i.e. 'C:\Program Files\ImageMagick-6.2.4-Q16' 
you will need to edit album_picm.php line ~290 to reflect this.

3: GD and version concerns
Support for GIF was restored in gd 2.0.28 on July 21st, 2004. Support for creating gif animations is also available. 
Note that gdlib-config --features can be used to list the image formats supported by gd. 
Versions of gdlib-config prior to recent updates do not support the --features option, which can be understood to mean that GIF is not available
Therefore edits will be required in several album files.
