$faq[] = array('What is ' . $progname . '?', $progname . ' is a web-based instant messenger client that we provide to our registered users so that they can easily and quickly contact each other. It is very similar to other instant messenger programs you may have used previously, but the users are generally limited to other members of this forum.');
$faq[] = array('Do I need to download software to use ' . $progname . '?', 'No, there is no software to download. The ' . $progname . ' software runs on this website. You can use and access the software through your web browser just like any normal web page or the forum itself.');
$faq[] = array('Do I need to register in the forums to use ' . $progname . '?', 'Yes. ' . $progname . ' is a part of the forums and uses the same user registration. It also uses parts of the private message system built into the forums. You cannot use the messenger until you have registered and logged in.');
$faq[] = array('Do I have to constantly stay at this site to use ' . $progname . '?', 'No, you do not. As long as you keep the ' . $progname . ' client window open, you can continue your web browsing as you normally would. Keep in mind that the messenger runs in your web browser, so if you exit your web browser completely, you will also exit the messenger.');
$faq[] = array('Are there any special settings my browser needs to use ' . $progname . '?', $progname . ' uses a great deal of JavaScript to provide control features and automatic opening of new windows. It is recommended that you have these options turned on for this web site. If you do not have these options turned on, you can still use the messenger. Some features may not work, however.');
$faq[] = array('How do I access ' . $progname . '?', 'First, make sure you have registered and logged in on the forums. On some forums, the board administrator can set ' . $progname . ' to open automatically when you visit the forum\'s index page. If the messenger does not open automatically, look for a link called "' . $lang['Launch_phpBB_IM'] . '," "' . $lang['Who_is_Online'] . '," or something similar. If there is a new instant message waiting for you, this link may state that you have a new IM. Click this link to open a new, specially sized browser window. This window, called the "IM Client," allows you to access ' . $progname . '.');
$faq[] = array('I did all that, but the window has some weird error message. Why?', 'There are several possible answers. It may be that the board administrator has temporarily disabled the software (possibly for an upgrade). It is also possible that the administrator has banned you from using the software. You didn\'t do anything naughty, did you?<br /><br />It is equally possible that you disabled the software previously yourself. In this case, the error message should contain a link to the preferences editor, where you can enable the software again.');
$faq[] = array('Okay, I have opened the IM Client. Now what?', 'From the IM Client window, you can do many things. You should see a list of users that are currently online. You can send these users an instant message. You can also send messages to other users, receive messages, view messages you have sent or received in the past, access the Contact List control panel, and, if the board administrator allows, access your messenger preferences.');

The IM Client may automatically open new messages in new, small, Read Message windows. Also, the client may list new and unread messages in the IM Client window itself. If messages are listed in the IM Client, you will see a shortened version of the messages\' subjects and sender\'s name. Click on the message subject to open a message in a new Read Message window.<br /><br />Depending on your user preferences, the IM Client may check for new instant messages only or for instant messages and private messages.
