IntegraMOD150
=============

This is the Integramod. This was the last build ever released to the general public. This version is built on phpBB 2.0.24 the unofficial release over at phpBB refugees. The images in this cms are all language ran as well if I am not mistaken. Nice touch.

There are some drawbacks to this package. 

1. It is a resource eater and LOVES it's sql querys. 
2. Some of the mods are so old in it, they no longer work on the new php and mysql versions.
3. It is no longer supported as Integramod.com is no more.
4. If you grab it and use it, I can give pointers but as for full out right support, that I can not do.

I do not have it in my power to update all the code to make it work. I REALLY wish I did as this was a great package at one point in time. It was probably one of the most complete packages on the net that did not cost hundreds of dollars a year per license. This one was free.

If I can get this installed and working, I will come back and post a complete list of mods it has preinstalled. Maybe you have or can update one of the non working mods and we can get this project back on track again...... As far as it can go with being phpBB2.

**UPDATE**

Some fixes were put in place today that made the package work again. I will be trying it out in the morning. Hopefully I have good news.
